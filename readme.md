My solution

All tasks were completed except bonus 1, which is half-done.
In bonus 1 I used ORM for Cake Entity, but I did not manage to use it for Order, since that Entity is covered in 3 tables.
This is my first time using ORM and it is actually pretty neat and useful. For now I am pushing my solution.
